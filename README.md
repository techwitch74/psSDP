**Powershell ExecutionPolicy**
--------------------------
Make sure script execution is allowed in PowerShell

-	Run: 

 ` Get-ExecutionPolicy`

-	If the policy comes back AllSigned, Default, or Restricted then scripting needs to be enabled.
-	Save the output to restore the policy when troubleshooting is complete

-	Then run: 

`  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
